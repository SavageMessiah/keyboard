# Features

* Colemak-dh
* Homerow mods with chordal hold to tame them
* All symbols on combos that are usable from any layer
* Too many layers hurt my brain so there's only two: nav and num
* Layer lock
* Capsword

Combo code is generated from `combos.clj`, use [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)

# Hardware

Wired chocofi built by Beekeeb with ambients nocturnals
Bobtail tenting legs.
