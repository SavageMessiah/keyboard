# Features

* Colemak-dh
* Homerow mods with [Achordion](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/achordion/index.html) to tame them
* All symbols on combos that are usable from any layer
* Too many layers hurt my brain so there's only two: nav and num
* [Layer Lock](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/layer-lock/index.html)
* Capsword

Combo code is generated from `combos.clj`, use [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)

# Hardware

Wired chocofi built by Beekeeb with 20g choc blues, modded with 1mm ball bearings in the stem holes to reduce travel.
Bobtail tenting legs.
